## âœ¨Sales Data Aggregation Yearly 

 - Description: Created a stored procedure in the Sales database that aggregates sales by year and saves the results in an external table.
   - Steps:
     1. **Provision Azure Synapse Analytics Workspace**: Set up an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace and data lake storage using a PowerShell script and ARM template.
     2. **Query Data in Files**: Use serverless SQL pool to query and preview sales data stored in CSV files.
     3. **Transform Data Using CETAS**: Use `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE AS SELECT` (CETAS) statements to transform and save data into external tables stored in the data lake.

     - Once the stored procedure is executed - a parquet file containing the aggregated yearly sales data has been created.

     - These files contain the aggregated product sales data. To prove this, we can select one of the files and use the New SQL script > Select TOP 100 rows menu to query it directly.
